More Background Info than Anyone Could Possibly Want

I've essentially been an iPhone programmer for 25 years now.

Back in the Before Time

Let me back up.  In 1989, I got access to a pre-release NeXT machine running
version 0.8 of the operating system software (because I was at Carnegie Mellon,
where the Mach kernel originated).  I was already focused on Unix development
in C, but dissatisifed with both X11 and C++, so I took to Objective-C and
AppKit like a fish to water.  I got my own NeXT machine and built up some real
expertise when the 68040 machines were introduced and I bought a "slab".  We're
talking about NeXTstep 2.0.

Back then, to _me_, NeXTstep/OpenStep development was _simple_.

You had a language with parts that were very clearly old-style "C" and distinct
parts that were very clearly SmallTalk-ish.  It was obvious to tell them apart;
if you saw square brackets with no array in sight, you were in new territory.
If you were already an expert in C (which I'd been using since middle school
in 1980), there really wasn't much more to learn in the language, and it was
easy to wrap my head around the whole thing.

You had a pretty simple "Interface Builder" setup where you sketched out the
GUI design of your application, dragged connections describing references and
method calls between pictures of both visual objects (eg. "buttons") and
abstract buttons (eg. "the thingy that does the work when you push buttons").

You may recall that this is basically the environment in which the original
"Doom" was written.  It was an *awesome* dev environment, and I got good with
it.  I wrote all sorts of tools, from things that sped up the day jobs of my
friends by an order of magnitude to tools that ripped apart the map files of
video games I was playig so I could study them.

Then the language started to change.  Interface Builder and Project Builder
split up.  Language features got added.

Then NeXT kinda mostly fell apart and, while I did poke at GNUstep a bit,
I didn't find a suitable substitute, and my productivity for personal coding
projects fell through the floor.  (This didn't impact my day jobs, mostly
writing portable server-side code in C, SQL, and a variety of other mediocre
languages.)

Then Apple bought NeXT, and made it clear that the future of the Macintosh
operating system would be based on OpenStep (nee NeXTstep).
